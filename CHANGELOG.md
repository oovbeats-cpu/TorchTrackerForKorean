## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

#### Web Dashboard
- FastAPI backend with REST API
- Browser-based dashboard at `http://localhost:8000`
- Real-time stats display: Total FE, Net Worth, Value/Hour, Runs, Prices
- Interactive charts using Chart.js:
  - Cumulative Value over time
  - Value/Hour over time (rolling 1-hour window)
- Recent Runs table with total loot value per run
- Run details modal showing loot breakdown with quantities and FE values
- Sortable inventory panel (click Qty/Value headers to sort)
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds (toggleable)
- Dark theme matching game aesthetic

#### Exchange Price Learning
- `ExchangeMessageParser` for multi-line exchange protocol messages
- Parses `XchgSearchPrice` send/receive messages from game logs
- Correlates requests (item searched) with responses (price listings)

- Calculates reference price using 10th percentile of listings
- Stores learned prices with `source="exchange"`
- Console output when prices are learned: `[Price] Item Name: 0.021000 FE`

#### Value-Based Calculations
- Run value = raw FE + sum(item_qty × item_price) for priced items
- Value/Hour stat using total loot value instead of raw FE
- Net worth = Total FE + valued inventory items
- Loot details show both quantity and FE value per item
- Items without prices show "no price" indicator
