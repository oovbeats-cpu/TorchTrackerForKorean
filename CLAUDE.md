# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TITrack is a **Torchlight Infinite Local Loot Tracker** - a Windows desktop application that reads game log files to track loot, calculate profit per map run, and display net worth. Inspired by WealthyExile (Path of Exile tracker).

**Key constraints:**
- Fully local, no cloud/internet required
- Portable EXE distribution (no Python/Node install needed)
- Privacy-focused (all data stored locally)
- No cheating/hooking/memory reading - only parses log files

## Korean Localization (한국어 버전)

This is a **Korean-localized fork** of TITrack with full Korean language support.

### Features

- **UI Translation**: All interface text translated to Korean in [index.html](src/titrack/web/static/index.html) and [app.js](src/titrack/web/static/app.js)
- **Korean Item Names**: Item names displayed in Korean throughout the application
- **Fallback System**: Korean name → English name → "알 수 없음 {id}" (Unknown)

### Korean Name Resolution

The [korean_names.py](src/titrack/data/korean_names.py) module loads Korean translations from [items_ko.json](src/titrack/data/items_ko.json):

```python
# In repository.py:444-452
def get_item_name(self, config_base_id: int) -> str:
    """Get item name, preferring Korean name, falling back to English."""
    ko_name = get_korean_name(config_base_id)  # First try Korean
    if ko_name:
        return ko_name
    item = self.get_item(config_base_id)      # Then English
    if item and item.name_en:
        return item.name_en
    return f"알 수 없음 {config_base_id}"      # Finally, Unknown
```

### Korean Translation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [items_ko.json](src/titrack/data/items_ko.json) | Korean item names (ConfigBaseId → Korean name mapping) |
| [korean_names.py](src/titrack/data/korean_names.py) | Translation loader module |

**Format of items_ko.json:**
```json
{
  "100300": { "name": "화염 원소", "type": "화폐", "price": 0 },
  "100": { "name": "클로", "type": "장비", "price": 0 }
}
```

### Adding/Updating Korean Translations

1. Edit [items_ko.json](src/titrack/data/items_ko.json) to add new items
2. Use ConfigBaseId (integer) as the JSON key (as string)
3. Include `name`, `type`, and `price` fields (price unused, kept for compatibility)
4. Rebuild with PyInstaller to bundle updated translations

### Korean-Specific Defaults

Several settings have different defaults for Korean users (defined in [preferences.py](src/titrack/config/preferences.py)):
- `trade_tax_enabled`: `True` (enabled by default)
- `map_costs_enabled`: `True` (enabled by default)

```

## Release Process

Each release includes two files:
- `TITrack-Setup.exe` - Recommended for users (avoids Windows MOTW security issues)
- `TITrack-x.x.x-windows.zip` - For advanced users who prefer manual extraction

### Steps to Release

1. **Update version** in both files:
   - `pyproject.toml` → `version = "x.x.x"`
   - `src/titrack/version.py` → `__version__ = "x.x.x"`

2. **Build main application**:
   ```bash
   python -m PyInstaller ti_tracker.spec --noconfirm
   ```

3. **Create ZIP**:
   ```powershell
   Compress-Archive -Path dist\TITrack -DestinationPath dist\TITrack-x.x.x-windows.zip -Force
   ```

4. **Build Setup.exe**:
   ```bash
   dotnet publish setup/TITrackSetup.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o setup/publish
   ```

5. **Commit, tag, and push**:
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "Release vx.x.x"
   git tag vx.x.x && git push origin master && git push origin vx.x.x
   ```

6. **Create GitHub release** with both files:
   ```bash
   gh release create vx.x.x setup/publish/TITrack-Setup.exe dist/TITrack-x.x.x-windows.zip --title "vx.x.x" --notes "Release notes here"
   ```

### Code Signing (Optional)

If you have an OV/EV code signing certificate:
```powershell
# Sign both executables
signtool sign /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 /fd sha256 /a "setup\publish\TITrack-Setup.exe"
signtool sign /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 /fd sha256 /a "dist\TITrack\TITrack.exe"
```

Sign before creating the ZIP and uploading to GitHub.

## Setup Project (TITrack-Setup.exe)

Located in `setup/` folder. A lightweight C# WinForms application (~174 KB) that:
- Downloads the latest release ZIP from GitHub
- Extracts to user-chosen location (portable, no installation)
- Avoids Mark of the Web (MOTW) issues since programmatic downloads aren't marked
- Optional desktop shortcut creation

The Setup.exe automatically fetches the latest release from GitHub API, so it doesn't need rebuilding for every release unless functionality changes.

**Requirements to build**: .NET 8 SDK (`winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8`)

## Architecture

Five main components:

1. **Collector (Log Tailer + Parser)** - Watches TI log file, parses events, computes item deltas
2. **Local Database (SQLite)** - Stores runs, deltas, slot state, prices, settings
3. **Price Engine** - Maps ConfigBaseId to price_fe, learns prices from Exchange searches
4. **Local Web UI** - FastAPI serves REST API + static files, opens in browser
5. **Packaged App** - PyInstaller EXE that starts all services

## Key Data Concepts

- **FE (Flame Elementium):** Primary valuation currency, ConfigBaseId = `100300`
- **ConfigBaseId:** Integer item type identifier from game logs
- **Delta tracking:** Logs report absolute stack totals (`Num=`), tracker computes changes vs previous state
- **Slot state:** Tracked per `(PageId, SlotId)` with current `(ConfigBaseId, Num)`

## Log Parsing

**Log file locations (auto-detected):**
- **Steam:** `<SteamLibrary>\steamapps\common\Torchlight Infinite\UE_Game\Torchlight\Saved\Logs\UE_game.log`
- **Standalone client:** `<InstallDir>\Game\UE_game\Torchlight\Saved\Logs\UE_game.log`

TITrack automatically checks common installation paths for both Steam and the standalone client. If the game is installed in a non-standard location, TITrack will prompt for the game directory on startup. The setting is saved to the database (`log_directory` in settings table) and persists across restarts.

**Flexible path input:** Users can provide the game root folder, the Logs folder, or the direct path to `UE_game.log` - TITrack will resolve any of these to the correct log file location.

**Key patterns to parse:**

```text
# Item pickup block
GameLog: Display: [Game] ItemChange@ ProtoName=PickItems start
GameLog: Display: [Game] BagMgr@:Modfy BagItem PageId = 102 SlotId = 0 ConfigBaseId = 100300 Num = 671
GameLog: Display: [Game] ItemChange@ ProtoName=PickItems end

# Inventory snapshot (triggered by sorting inventory in-game)
GameLog: Display: [Game] BagMgr@:InitBagData PageId = 102 SlotId = 0 ConfigBaseId = 100300 Num = 609

# Map boundaries
LevelMgr@ EnterLevel ...
LevelMgr@ OpenLevel ...
```

**Parsing rules:**
- Incremental tail (handle log rotation)
- Delta = current `Num` - previous `Num` for same slot/item
- Tag changes inside PickItems block as "pickup-related"
- Handle unknown ConfigBaseIds gracefully (show as "Unknown <id>")
- `InitBagData` events update slot state but don't create deltas (used for inventory sync)

## Database Schema (Core Tables)

- `settings` - key/value config
- `runs` - map instances (start_ts, end_ts, zone_sig, level_id, level_type, level_uid)
- `item_deltas` - per-item changes with run_id, context, proto_name
- `slot_state` - current inventory state per (page_id, slot_id)
- `items` - item metadata (name, icon_url, category)
- `prices` - item valuation (price_fe, source, updated_ts)

## Item Database

`tlidb_items_seed_en.json` contains 1,811 items with:
- `id` (ConfigBaseId as string)
- `name_en`, `name_cn`
- `img` (icon URL)
- `url_en`, `url_cn` (TLIDB links)

Seeds the `items` table on first run.

## File Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `TI_Local_Loot_Tracker_PRD.md` | Complete requirements document |
| `tlidb_items_seed_en.json` | Item database seed (1,811 items) |

## Storage Locations (Runtime)

- Default: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TITracker\tracker.db`
- Portable mode: `.\data\tracker.db` beside exe

## Native Window Mode

The packaged EXE runs in a native window using pywebview (EdgeChromium on Windows) instead of opening in the default browser. This provides a cleaner user experience with no visible CLI window.

- **Window title**: "TITrack - Torchlight Infinite Loot Tracker"
- **Default size**: 1280x800, minimum 800x600
- **Shutdown**: Closing the window gracefully stops all services
- **Browser fallback**: If pywebview/pythonnet fails (e.g., due to Windows MOTW blocking DLLs), the app automatically falls back to browser mode with an Exit button

For debugging, run with `--no-window` flag to use browser mode instead:
```bash
TITrack.exe --no-window
```

### Windows Mark of the Web (MOTW) Issue

Files downloaded from the internet are marked by Windows as untrusted. This can prevent pythonnet DLLs from loading, causing native window mode to fail.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use TITrack-Setup.exe** (recommended) - Downloads programmatically, no MOTW
2. **Unblock after extracting**: `Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\TITrack" -Recurse | Unblock-File`
3. **Code signing** - Signed executables bypass MOTW restrictions

## Logging

All console output is redirected to a log file when running as a packaged EXE:
- **Portable mode**: `.\data\titrack.log` beside exe
- **Default**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TITracker\titrack.log`

Log rotation:
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Keeps 3 backup files (titrack.log.1, .2, .3)

In development mode (non-frozen), logs also output to console.

## MVP Requirements

1. Select & persist log file path
2. Tail log, parse PickItems + BagMgr updates
3. Compute deltas, store in DB
4. Segment runs (EnterLevel-based boundaries)
5. Display FE gained per run, profit/hr
6. Automatic price learning from Exchange searches
7. Net worth from latest inventory
8. Packaged portable EXE

- **Current Inventory**: Sortable by quantity or value
- **Controls**: Cloud Sync toggle, Settings button, Reset Stats, Auto-refresh toggle
- **Settings Modal**: Trade Tax toggle, Map Costs toggle, Game Directory configuration (with Browse button in native window mode)

## Loot Report

The "Report" button in the Recent Runs section opens a modal showing cumulative loot statistics across all runs since the last reset.

### Summary Stats

- **Gross Value**: Total value of all loot picked up in maps
- **Map Costs**: Total cost of compasses/beacons consumed (only shown if Map Costs setting enabled)
- **Profit**: Gross Value minus Map Costs
- **Runs**: Number of completed map runs
- **Total Time**: Combined duration of all map runs
- **Profit/Hour**: Profit divided by total time spent in maps
- **Profit/Map**: Average profit per map run
- **Unique Items**: Number of distinct item types collected

### Chart

A doughnut chart visualizes the top 10 items by value, with remaining items grouped as "Other". The legend shows item names with percentages.

### Table

A scrollable table lists all items with:
- Icon and name
- Quantity collected
- Unit price (from local or cloud pricing)
- Total value (quantity × unit price)
- Percentage of total value

Items without known prices show "--" and appear at the bottom.

### CSV Export

Click "Export CSV" to save the report. A native "Save As" dialog lets you choose the file location. The CSV includes:
- All items with quantities, prices, and values
- Summary section with all stats

### Data Filtering

- Only includes items picked up during map runs (excludes trade house purchases, crafting, etc.)
- Excludes map costs (Spv3Open events) from loot totals
- Excludes gear page items (PageId 100)
- Respects Trade Tax setting when calculating values

## Trade Tax

The Torchlight trade house takes a 12.5% tax (1 FE per 8 FE). Enable the "Trade Tax" toggle in Settings to see after-tax values:
- Applied to non-FE items only (FE currency is not taxed)
- Affects: Run values, inventory net worth, value/hour calculations
- Setting stored in database as `trade_tax_enabled`

## Map Costs

When enabled, TITrack tracks compass/beacon consumption when opening maps and subtracts these costs from run values.

### How It Works

1. When you open a map with a compass/beacon, the game logs an `ItemChange@ ProtoName=Spv3Open` block
2. TITrack captures these consumption events and associates them with the next map run
3. Run values show net profit (gross loot value minus map cost)

### Enabling Map Costs

Click the gear icon (Settings) in the header and enable "Map Costs" toggle.

### Display

When map costs are enabled:
- **Recent Runs table**: Shows net value (with warning icon if some costs are unpriced)
- **Run Details modal**: Shows map costs section with consumed items, followed by summary (Gross / Cost / Net)
- **Current Run panel**: Shows net value with cost breakdown
- **Stats**: Value/Hour and Value/Map reflect net values after costs

### Unknown Prices

If a consumed item doesn't have a known price:
- The item shows "?" instead of a value with tooltip
- A warning icon appears next to the run value
- The cost is excluded from calculations (only priced items are summed)
- Search the item on the Exchange to learn its price

### Settings

- Setting stored in database as `map_costs_enabled`
- Default: disabled (gross values shown)

## Zone Translation

Zone names are mapped in `src/titrack/data/zones.py`. The `ZONE_NAMES` dictionary maps internal zone path patterns to English display names. Use `/api/stats/zones` to see all encountered zones and identify which need translation.

## Price Seeding

Prices can be seeded on init: `titrack init --seed items.json --prices-seed prices.json`

Export current prices via `GET /api/prices/export`.

## Zone Differentiation

Some zones share the same internal path across different areas (e.g., "Grimwind Woods" appears in both Glacial Abyss and Voidlands with the same path `YL_BeiFengLinDi201`).

These are differentiated using `LevelId` from the game logs:
- The `LevelMgr@ LevelUid, LevelType, LevelId` line is parsed before zone transitions
- LevelId format: `XXYY` where `XX` = Timemark tier, `YY` = zone identifier
- For ambiguous zones, `level_id % 100` extracts the zone suffix to determine the region

### LevelId Structure

| Timemark | XX Value |
|----------|----------|
| 7-0 | 46 |
| 8-0 | 50 |
| 8-1 | 51 |
| 8-2 | 52 |
| etc. | +1 per sub-tier |

### Ambiguous Zone Suffixes

| Zone | Suffix | Region |
|------|--------|--------|
| Grimwind Woods | 06 | Glacial Abyss |
| Grimwind Woods | 54 | Voidlands |
| Elemental Mine | 12 | Blistering Lava Sea |
| Elemental Mine | 55 | Voidlands |
| Demiman Village | 36 | Glacial Abyss |

To add a new ambiguous zone:
1. Run the zone and check the log for `LevelMgr@ LevelUid, LevelType, LevelId = X Y ZZZZ`
2. The last 2 digits of LevelId are the zone suffix
3. Add the suffix mapping to `AMBIGUOUS_ZONES` in `src/titrack/data/zones.py`

For special zones (bosses, secret realms) that don't follow the XXYY pattern, add exact LevelId mappings to `LEVEL_ID_ZONES`.

## Inventory Sync

To sync your full inventory with the tracker, use the **Sort** button in-game:
1. Open your inventory (bag)
2. Click the Sort/Arrange button (auto-organizes items)
3. The game logs `BagMgr@:InitBagData` lines for every slot
4. TITrack captures these and updates slot state without creating deltas

This is useful when:
- Starting the tracker for the first time (existing inventory not tracked)
- Inventory state gets out of sync
- You want to ensure accurate net worth calculation

## Player Info & Multi-Character Support

Player/character information is parsed from the main game log (`UE_game.log`). The parser looks for lines containing `+player+Name`, `+player+SeasonId`, etc.

- **Name**: Player's character name
- **SeasonId**: League/season identifier (mapped to display name in `player_parser.py`)

The dashboard displays the character name and season name in the header.

### Automatic Character Detection

TITrack detects characters by monitoring player data lines in the **live** log stream. On startup, the app shows "Waiting for character login..." until a character is detected.

**Important**: You must log in (or relog) your character **after** starting TITrack for it to detect your character. Historical player data from before TITrack started is not read.

When you switch characters in-game, TITrack automatically detects the change:

1. Player data lines (`+player+Name`, `+player+SeasonId`, etc.) are parsed as they appear
2. When a different character is detected, the collector switches context
3. Inventories, runs, and prices are isolated per character/season

### Data Isolation

Each character has isolated data using an **effective player ID**:
- If the log contains a `PlayerId`, that is used
- Otherwise, `{season_id}_{name}` is used as the identifier (e.g., `1301_MyChar`)

This ensures:
- **Inventory**: Each character has separate slot states
- **Runs/Deltas**: Tagged with season_id and player_id
- **Prices**: Isolated per season (seasonal vs permanent economies are separate)

### Migrating Legacy Prices

If you have prices from before multi-season support was added, they may be stored with `season_id=0`. To migrate them to your current season:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/prices/migrate-legacy
```

Run this while logged in as the character whose economy should receive the prices.

## Inventory Tab Filtering

The game inventory has 4 tabs identified by PageId:
- **PageId 100**: Gear (equipment) - **EXCLUDED from tracking**
- **PageId 101**: Skill
- **PageId 102**: Commodity (currency, crafting materials)
- **PageId 103**: Misc

The Gear tab is excluded because gear prices are too dependent on specific affixes to be reliably tracked. This filtering is defined in `src/titrack/data/inventory.py` and applied at:
- Collector level (bag events from excluded pages are skipped)
- Repository queries (slot states and deltas filtered by default)

To modify which tabs are tracked, edit `EXCLUDED_PAGES` in `src/titrack/data/inventory.py`.

## Cloud Sync (Crowd-Sourced Pricing)

TITrack supports opt-in cloud sync to share and receive community pricing data.

### Features

- **Anonymous**: Uses device-based UUIDs, no user accounts required
- **Opt-in**: Disabled by default, toggle in the UI header
- **Offline-capable**: Works fully offline, syncs when connected
- **Cloud-first pricing**: Cloud prices are used by default, local prices override only when newer

### How It Works

1. When you search an item in the in-game Exchange, TITrack captures the prices
2. If cloud sync is enabled, the price data is queued for upload
3. Background threads upload your submissions and download community prices
4. Community prices are used for inventory valuation and run value calculations

### Pricing Priority

The `get_effective_price()` method implements cloud-first pricing logic:

1. **Cloud price is the default** - Community aggregate (median) is more reliable
2. **Local price overrides only if newer** - Compares `local.updated_at` vs `cloud.cloud_updated_at`
3. If only one source exists, that price is used
4. If timestamp comparison fails, defaults to cloud price

This means:
- Fresh install with cloud sync enabled → uses cloud prices immediately
- You search an item in Exchange → local price saved with current timestamp
- If your local search is newer than cloud data → your price is used
- When cloud data is updated → cloud price takes over again

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/cloud/status` - Sync status, queue counts, last sync times
- `POST /api/cloud/toggle` - Enable/disable cloud sync
- `POST /api/cloud/sync` - Manual sync trigger
- `GET /api/cloud/prices` - Cached community prices
- `GET /api/cloud/prices/{id}/history` - Price history for sparklines

### Settings API

- `GET /api/settings/{key}` - Get setting (whitelisted keys only)
- `PUT /api/settings/{key}` - Update setting

### Database Tables (Cloud Sync)

- `cloud_sync_queue` - Prices waiting to upload
- `cloud_price_cache` - Downloaded community prices
- `cloud_price_history` - Hourly price snapshots for sparklines

### Settings Keys

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `cloud_sync_enabled` | `"false"` | Master toggle |
| `cloud_device_id` | (generated) | Anonymous device UUID |
| `cloud_upload_enabled` | `"true"` | Upload prices to cloud |
| `cloud_download_enabled` | `"true"` | Download prices from cloud |

### Sparklines (Price Trend Charts)

The inventory panel shows sparkline charts in the "Trend" column when cloud sync is enabled. These mini-charts visualize price history over time.

**How sparklines work:**
1. When the inventory renders, sparkline canvases are created for items with cloud prices
2. History data is lazy-loaded from `/api/cloud/prices/{id}/history` for each item
3. Results are cached to avoid redundant fetches

**Visual indicators:**
- **Green line**: Price trending up (>1% increase from first to last point)
- **Red line**: Price trending down (>1% decrease)
- **Gray line**: Price stable (within ±1%)
- **Dashed gray line**: Insufficient history data (fewer than 2 data points)
- **Three dots**: Loading state while fetching history

**Sparkline vs. Community indicator:**
- **Sparklines** appear for any item with a cloud price (even single contributor)
- **Community indicator** (dot next to item name) only appears for prices with 3+ contributors

Click any sparkline to open the full price history modal with detailed chart.

### Supabase Backend (Not Configured)

Cloud sync requires a Supabase backend. The backend is NOT configured by default. To enable:

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Run the SQL migrations to create tables and functions
3. Set environment variables:
   - `TITRACK_SUPABASE_URL` - Your project URL
   - `TITRACK_SUPABASE_KEY` - Your anon key
4. Or update the defaults in `src/titrack/sync/client.py`

Install the Supabase SDK: `pip install titrack[cloud]`

## Known Limitations / TODO

- **Timemark level not tracked**: The game log zone paths are identical regardless of Timemark level (e.g., 7-0 vs 8-0). Runs of the same zone are grouped together. To support per-Timemark tracking, would need to find another log line that indicates the Timemark level (possibly when selecting beacon or starting map) or add manual run tagging in the UI.
- **Cloud sync backend not configured**: The Supabase backend URLs/keys need to be configured before cloud sync will work.
